    "text": "Philosophy\nMost hams agree that getting their “ticket” or license was the start of the journey, not the destination. In fact, for many hams, much of the material that must be mastered to pass one of the licensing exams only really makes sense in the specific context of operating or doing something related to operating. So, our philosophy with this book is to emphasize hands-on activities, operating practices, and especially listening. Other hams may have other ideas about the right approach. We think that there are many good ways to go forward, and this one particularly appeals to us.\nIn the U.S., you don’t need a license to listen, and even if you are an active operator, you’ll spend most of your time listening. Many hams started out as shortwave listeners (SWLs) back when the airwaves were full of shortwave stations that broadcasted programs in the ham bands or adjacent to ham bands. And listening to other hams operate is one of the best ways to learn what to do, and sometimes, what not to do.",

    "text": "Visit the K3FEF web SDR\nGo to http://websdr.k3fef.com. This station is located in Milford, Pennsylvania on the Delaware River. It’s the closest one to Penn State. So, it’s often one to consult for listeners in our area.\nHere is a screenshot of the K3FEF control panel.\n\n\n\nK3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com\n\n\nThe dark blue area at the top depicts the band activity at the time you visit. The figure shows radio signals being heard by K3FEF from about 3300 kHz (3.3 MHz) below the 80m ham band to 5300 kHz (5.5 MHz) in the 60m ham band.\nIf you are watching this on the web, you will see upwards motion. This is how the webSDR depicts the time series or history of recent signals. So, time is on the vertical axis of this two-dimensional figure. Sometimes this type of frequency-over-time display is called a waterfall. Except this waterfall falls upward.\nBelow the figure are some orange ‘flag’ or labels that other listeners have added. These identify the specific transmissions. If you look especially closely, you’ll also see a yellow ‘hump’ around 3875 kHz. That’s the specific frequency this SDR defaulted to when we opened it up. We’ll explain what the yellow hump means a bit later.\nIn the static figure above, you’ll notice a lot of activity between about 3550 kHz and 4000 kHz. The 80m and 75m ham bands occupy 3500-4000 kHz, so those are hams communicating. The figure was taken about 8:00am EDT (1200 UTC). These bands are usually open from evening to mid-morning.\nLet’s focus on the white panel below the waterfall.\n\n\n\nK3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com\n\n\nThe panel’s Frequency control tells us that our radio is tuned to 3875 MHz, right in the middle of the 80/75m band, the phone (voice) portion. There are some controls to change the frequency, then below that, a set of buttons to change the band. The highlighted button confirms that we are in the 80/75m band1.\nNotice that the K3FEF webSDR covers ham bands up through 6m. It does not cover the 15m or 12m bands, though.\nBelow the Frequency control is a set of buttons that control Bandwidth. No, bandwidth is not the size of your favorite jazz combo. Bandwidth means how much of the frequency spectrum the webSDR is capturing at this moment, centered on the 3875 [kHz] frequency we just mentioned. Different types of radio transmissions (voice vs. Morse code/[CW] for example) have different bandwidths. We often want to adjust our bandwidth to match the type of signal. If the bandwidth is much wider than the signal, we’re just adding noise. If the bandwidth is much narrower than the signal, we can lose information. Voice transmissions have wider bandwidth than Morse code/[CW]. And different types of voice signals have different bandwidths. [FM] is the widest, for example; [AM] is in the middle; and single sideband [SSB] the narrowest.\nOur bandwidth is 9.69 [kHz] @ -6 [dB] 2. That’s wide, except for broadcast FM stations. We can adjust the bandwidth incrementally using the wider/narrower buttons or adjust the bandwidth to match a specific type of signal: CW-wide/CW-nrw (narrow), LSB-wide/LSB-nrw, USB-wide/USB-nrw, AM-wide/AM-nrw, and FM. We can also adjust the bandwidth manually.",

Zoom in by clicking on the button a couple of times. Sometimes zooming moves window beyond the frequency where you are currently tuned. If that happens, you won’t see the yellow ‘hump’ anymore.\nBut you can find it again by clicking on the blue/purple area in the waterfall and dragging to the left or the right to put your current frequency–3875 kHz for our example–in the middle of the panel.\nIn our case, there’s a very strong signal around 3810 kHz.\n\n\n\nK3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com\n\n\nNotice that most of the signal around 3810 kHz (3.810 MHz) lies below 3810. That’s because on 75m and 80m, hams use Lower Sideband ([LSB]) for [phone] transmissions. To see another example of what LSB and upper sideband ([USB]) signals look like, see figure below.",

    "text": "Going further\nNow that you’ve gotten familiar with the K3FEF WebSDR, you might be curious to know what else there is to listen to, and equally important, when. I say when because the high frequency (HF) bands change their propagation characteristics–how far and how well they convey radio signals–based on the time of day, season of the year, and phase of the 11-year sunspot cycle, among other characteristics. We’ll do a deeper dive on these topics in the Band Conditions quest. For now, here are some general rules of thumb about where to listen and when:\n75m/80m: These bands provide long distance (DX) communication at night, especially in the winter months, and regional communication in the early morning hours.\n40m: This band also provides long distance communication at night and more reliable regional communication in the daylight hours.\n20m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours.\n17m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours.\n15m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours.\n12m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours during the peak times of the sunspot cycle. It is often closed at the depth of that cycle.\n10m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours during the peak times of the sunspot cycle. It is often closed at the depth of that cycle.\nNow, you might be interested to know what’s worth listening to or for. My recommendation would be for you to listen to established nets that have published schedules. For example, you can search for a net that meets specific criteria on the ARRL website at www.arrl.org/arrl-net-directory-search. You may also want to try the NetFinder site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt would be good to add some information about some SWL stations that are easy to hear.\nAlso, there are some nets that are good examples, e.g., the M-Su Rooster Net on 3.990 MHz (daily 6:00am Eastern time) and the YSL System Nets, and some frequencies that are not good examples, e.g., 7.200 MHz and 14.313 MHz.",

So, the approximate speed of light (in millions of meters per second) divided by the frequency in MHz gives us the approximate wavelength of radio waves. It’s a single 0.5 MHz (500 kHz) chunk of frequency reserved exclusively for amateurs that roughly bracket ~80-75m.↩︎\nThis means that if we look at the peak signal at 3875 kHz and calculate the point on both sides of 3875 kHz where the signal drops by 6 decibels (db) or about 4-fold, we’re left with 9.69 kHz of signal. The width of the yellow ‘hump’ in the waterfall display shows us this bandwidth visually.↩︎",

Location matters for two reasons:\n\nIf you want to set up a station with HF capability, you’ll want and need to put your antenna somewhere else–not in the room with your radio gear. That somewhere else will often be outside although some hams have success putting antennas in an attic. If your antenna or antennas are outside, you’ll need a way to send RF signals to them.\nAll things being equal, you want your antenna feedlines to be as short as possible. Your feedlines dissipate RF power, although usually not very much if you use decent quality ones. Still, you want to pick a location in your home so that your equipment is as close to your antenna as possible so that your feedlines can be as short as possible.\nYou’ll need access to electrical power (120 V).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf your situation requires long feedlines, don’t worry.

A radiocommunication service for the purpose of self-training, intercommunication and technical investigations carried out by amateurs, that is, duly authorized persons interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim and without pecuniary interest.\n\n\nAmateur station. A station in an amateur radio service consisting of the apparatus necessary for carrying on radiocommunications.\n\n\nAutomatic control. The use of devices and procedures for control of a station when it is transmitting so that compliance with the FCC Rules is achieved without the control operator being present at a control point.\n\n\nAuxiliary station. An amateur station, other than in a message forwarding system, that is transmitting communications point-to-point within a system of cooperating amateur stations.\n\n\nBandwidth. The width of a frequency band outside of which the mean power of the transmitted signal is attenuated at least 26 dB below the mean power of the transmitted signal within the band.\n\n\nBeacon. An amateur station transmitting communications for the purposes of observation of propagation and reception or other related experimental activities.\n\n\nBroadcasting. Transmissions intended for reception by the general public, either direct or relayed.\n\nCall sign system. The method used to select a call sign for amateur station over-the-air identification purposes. The call sign systems are:\n\n\nSequential call sign system. The call sign is selected by the FCC from an alphabetized list corresponding to the geographic region of the licensee’s mailing address and operator class. The call sign is shown on the license. The FCC will issue public announcements detailing the procedures of the sequential call sign system.\nVanity call sign system. The call sign is selected by the FCC from a list of call signs requested by the licensee. The call sign is shown on the license. The FCC will issue public announcements detailing the procedures of the vanity call sign system.\nSpecial event call sign system. The call sign is selected by the station licensee from a list of call signs shown on a common data base coordinated, maintained and disseminated by the amateur station special event call sign data base coordinators.

No station shall transmit messages for a third party to any station within the jurisdiction of any foreign government whose administration has not made such an arrangement. This prohibition does not apply to a message for any third party who is eligible to be a control operator of the station.\n\n\n\nThe third party may participate in stating the message where:\n\n\n\nThe control operator is present at the control point and is continuously monitoring and supervising the third party’s participation; and\n\n\nThe third party is not a prior amateur service licensee whose license was revoked or not renewed after hearing and re-licensing has not taken place; suspended for less than the balance of the license term and the suspension is still in effect; suspended for the balance of the license term and re-licensing has not taken place; or surrendered for cancellation following notice of revocation, suspension or monetary forfeiture proceedings. The third party may not be the subject of a cease and desist order which relates to amateur service operation and which is still in effect.\n\n\n\nNo station may transmit third party communications while being automatically controlled except a station transmitting a RTTY or data emission.\nAt the end of an exchange of international third party communications, the station must also transmit in the station identification procedure the call sign of the station with which a third party message was exchanged.\n\n[54 FR 25857, June 20, 1989; 54 FR 39535, Sept. 27, 1989, as amended at 71 FR 25982, May 3, 2006; 71 FR 66462, Nov. 15, 2006]\n\n\n§ 97.117 International communications.\nTransmissions to a different country, where permitted, shall be limited to communications incidental to the purposes of the amateur service and to remarks of a personal character.\n[71 FR 25982, May 3, 2006]\n\n\n§ 97.119 Station identification.\n\nEach amateur station, except a space station or telecommand station, must transmit its assigned call sign on its transmitting channel at the end of each communication, and at least every 10 minutes during a communication, for the purpose of clearly making the source of the transmissions from the station known to those receiving the transmissions. No station may transmit unidentified communications or signals, or transmit as the station call sign, any call sign not authorized to the station.\nThe call sign must be transmitted with an emission authorized for the transmitting channel in one of the following ways:\n\n\n\nBy a CW emission. When keyed by an automatic device used only for identification, the speed must not exceed 20 words per minute;\n\n\nBy a phone emission in the English language. Use of a phonetic alphabet as an aid for correct station identification is encouraged;\n\n\nBy a RTTY emission using a specified digital code when all or part of the communications are transmitted by a RTTY or data emission;\n\n\nBy an image emission conforming to the applicable transmission standards, either color or monochrome, of § 73.682(a) of the FCC Rules when all or part of the communications are transmitted in the same image emission\n\n\n\nOne or more indicators may be included with the call sign. Each indicator must be separated from the call sign by the slant mark (/) or by any suitable word that denotes the slant mark. If an indicator is self-assigned, it must be included before, after, or both before and after, the call sign. No self-assigned indicator may conflict with any other indicator specified by the FCC Rules or with any prefix assigned to another country.\nWhen transmitting in conjunction with an event of special significance, a station may substitute for its assigned call sign a special event call sign as shown for that station for that period of time on the common data base coordinated, maintained and disseminated by the special event call sign data base coordinators. Additionally, the station must transmit its assigned call sign at least once per hour during such transmissions.\nWhen the operator license class held by the control operator exceeds that of the station licensee, an indicator consisting of the call sign assigned to the control operator’s station must be included after the call sign.\nWhen the control operator is a person who is exercising the rights and privileges authorized by § 97.9(b) of this part, an indicator must be included after the call sign as follows:\n\n\n\nFor a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice Class to Technical Class: KT;\n\n\nFor a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice or Technician to General Class: AG;\n\n\nFor a control operator who has requested a license modification from Novice, Technician, General, or Advanced Class to Amateur Extra Class: AE.\n\n\n\nWhen the station is transmitting under the authority of § 97.107 of this part, an indicator consisting of the appropriate letter-numeral designating the station location must be included before the call sign that was issued to the station by the country granting the license. For an amateur service license granted by the Government of Canada, however, the indicator must be included after the call sign. At least once during each intercommunication, the identification announcement must include the geographical location as nearly as possible by city and state, commonwealth or possession.\n\n[54 FR 25857, June 20, 1989, as amended at 54 FR 39535, Sept. 27, 1989; 55 FR 30457, July 26, 1990; 56 FR 28, Jan. 2, 1991; 62 FR 17567, Apr. 10, 1997; 63 FR 68980, Dec. 14, 1998; 64 FR 51471, Sept. 23, 1999; 66 FR 20752, Apr. 25, 2001; 75 FR 78171, Dec. 15, 2010]\n\n\n§ 97.121 Restricted operation.\n\nIf the operation of an amateur station causes general interference to the reception of transmissions from stations operating in the domestic broadcast service when receivers of good engineering design, including adequate selectivity characteristics, are used to receive such transmissions, and this fact is made known to the amateur station licensee, the amateur station shall not be operated during the hours from 8 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., local time, and on Sunday for the additional period from 10:30 a.m. until 1 p.m., local time, upon the frequency or frequencies used when the interference is created.\nIn general, such steps as may be necessary to minimize interference to stations operating in other services may be required after investigation by the FCC.",

The collision risk may be assumed zero for a space station during any period in which the space station will be maneuvered effectively to avoid colliding with large objects.\nThe statement must identify characteristics of the space station(s)’ orbits that may present a collision risk, including any planned and/or operational space stations in those orbits, and indicate what steps, if any, have been taken to coordinate with the other spacecraft or system, or what other measures the operator plans to use to avoid collision.\nIf at any time during the space station(s)’ mission or de-orbit phase the space station(s) will transit through the orbits used by any inhabitable spacecraft, including the International Space Station, the statement must describe the design and operational strategies, if any, that will be used to minimize the risk of collision and avoid posing any operational constraints to the inhabitable spacecraft.\nThe statement must disclose the accuracy, if any, with which orbital parameters will be maintained, including apogee, perigee, inclination, and the right ascension of the ascending node(s). In the event that a system is not be maintained to specific orbital tolerances, e.g., its propulsion system will not be used for orbital maintenance, that fact should be included in the debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems must also indicate the anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of the proposed satellite or satellites. All systems must describe the extent of satellite maneuverability, whether or not the space station design includes a propulsion system.\nThe space station operator must certify that upon receipt of a space situational awareness conjunction warning, the operator will review and take all possible steps to assess the collision risk, and will mitigate the collision risk if necessary. As appropriate, steps to assess and mitigate the collision risk should include, but are not limited to: Contacting the operator of any active spacecraft involved in such a warning; sharing ephemeris data and other appropriate operational information with any such operator; and modifying space station attitude and/or operations.\n\n\nWhere a space station requests the assignment of a geostationary orbit location, it must assess whether there are any known satellites located at, or reasonably expected to be located at, the requested orbital location, or assigned in the vicinity of that location, such that the station keeping volumes of the respective satellites might overlap or touch. If so, the statement must include a statement as to the identities of those parties and the measures that will be taken to prevent collisions.\n\n\nA statement addressing the trackability of the space station(s). Space station(s) operating in low-Earth orbit will be presumed trackable if each individual space station is 10 cm or larger in its smallest dimension, exclusive of deployable components. Where the application is for an NGSO space station or system, the statement shall also disclose the following:\n\n\nHow the operator plans to identify the space station(s) following deployment and whether space station tracking will be active or passive;\nWhether, prior to deployment, the space station(s) will be registered with the 18th Space Control Squadron or successor entity; and\nThe extent to which the space station operator plans to share information regarding initial deployment, ephemeris, and/or planned maneuvers with the 18th Space Control Squadron or successor entity, other entities that engage in space situational awareness or space traffic management functions, and/or other operators.\n\n\nA statement disclosing planned proximity operations, if any, and addressing debris generation that will or may result from the proposed operations, including any planned release of debris, the risk of accidental explosions, the risk of accidental collision, and measures taken to mitigate those risks.\nA statement detailing the disposal plans for the space station, including the quantity of fuel—if any—that will be reserved for disposal maneuvers. In addition, the following specific provisions apply:\n\n\nFor geostationary orbit space stations, the statement must disclose the altitude selected for a disposal orbit and the calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude.\nFor space stations terminating operations in an orbit in or passing through the low-Earth orbit region below 2,000 km altitude, the statement must disclose whether the spacecraft will be disposed of either through atmospheric re-entry, specifying if direct retrieval of the spacecraft will be used. The statement must also disclose the expected time in orbit for the space station following the completion of the mission.\nFor space stations not covered by either paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(A) or (B) of this section, the statement must indicate whether disposal will involve use of a storage orbit or long-term atmospheric re-entry and rationale for the selected disposal plan.\nFor all NGSO space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(B) or (C) of this section, the following additional specific provisions apply:\n\n\nThe statement must include a demonstration that the probability of success of the chosen disposal method will be 0.9 or greater for any individual space station. For space station systems consisting of multiple space stations, the demonstration should include additional information regarding efforts to achieve a higher probability of success, with a goal, for large systems, of a probability of success for any individual space station of 0.99 or better. For space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(B) of this section that will be terminating operations in or passing through low-Earth orbit, successful disposal is defined as atmospheric re-entry of the spacecraft within 25 years or less following completion of the mission. For space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(C) of this section, successful disposal will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nIf planned disposal is by atmospheric re-entry, the statement must also include:\n\n\nA disclosure indicating whether the atmospheric re-entry will be an uncontrolled re-entry or a controlled targeted reentry.\nAn assessment as to whether portions of any individual spacecraft will survive atmospheric re-entry and impact the surface of the Earth with a kinetic energy in excess of 15 joules, and demonstration that the calculated casualty risk for an individual spacecraft using the NASA Debris Assessment Software or a higher fidelity assessment tool is less than 0.0001 (1 in 10,000).\nIf any material item described in this notification changes before launch, a replacement pre-space notification shall be filed with the International Bureau no later than 90 days before integration of the space station into the launch vehicle.\n\n\nAn in-space station notification is required no later than 7 days following initiation of space station transmissions. This notification must update the information contained in the pre-space notification.\nA post-space station notification is required no later than 3 months after termination of the space station transmissions. When termination of transmissions is ordered by the FCC, the notification is required no later than 24 hours after termination of transmissions.\n\n[54 FR 25857, June 20, 1989, as amended at 54 FR 39535, Sept. 27, 1989; 56 FR 56171, Nov. 1, 1991; 57 FR 32736, July 23, 1992; 60 FR 50124, Sept. 28, 1995; 63 FR 68980, Dec. 14, 1998; 69 FR 54588, Sept. 9, 2004; 71 FR 66462, Nov. 15, 2006; 75 FR 27201, May 14, 2010; 85 FR 52453, Aug. 25, 2020; 85 FR 64068, Oct. 9, 2020]\n\n\n§ 97.209 Earth station.\n\nAny amateur station may be an Earth station.

2020]\n\n\n§ 97.303 Frequency sharing requirements.\nThe following paragraphs summarize the frequency sharing requirements that apply to amateur stations transmitting in the frequency bands specified in § 97.301 of this part. Each frequency band allocated to the amateur service is designated as either a secondary service or a primary service. A station in a secondary service must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations in a primary service.\n\nWhere, in adjacent ITU Regions or sub-Regions, a band of frequencies is allocated to different services of the same category (i.e., primary or secondary services), the basic principle is the equality of right to operate. Accordingly, stations of each service in one Region or sub-Region must operate so as not to cause harmful interference to any service of the same or higher category in the other Regions or sub-Regions.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 70 cm band, the 33 cm band, the 23 cm band, the 5 cm band, the 3 cm band, or the 24.05–24.25 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States Government in the radiolocation service.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 76–81 GHz segment, the 136–141 GHz segment, or the 241–248 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States Government, the FCC, or other nations in the radiolocation service.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 430–450 MHz segment, the 23 cm band, the 3.3–3.4 GHz segment, the 5.65–5.85 GHz segment, the 13 cm band, or the 24.05–24.25 GHz segment, must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by other nations in the radiolocation service.\nAmateur stations receiving in the 33 cm band, the 2400–2450 MHz segment, the 5.725–5.875 GHz segment, the 1.2 cm band, the 2.5 mm band, or the 244–246 GHz segment must accept interference from industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the following segments must not cause harmful interference to radio astronomy stations: 76–81 GHz, 136–141 GHz, 241–248 GHz, 275–323 GHz, 327–371 GHz, 388–424 GHz, 426–442 GHz, 453–510 GHz, 623–711 GHz, 795–909 GHz, or 926–945 GHz. In addition, amateur stations transmitting in the following segments must not cause harmful interference to stations in the Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) or the space research service (passive): 275–286 GHz, 296–306 GHz, 313–356 GHz, 361–365 GHz, 369–392 GHz, 397–399 GHz, 409–411 GHz, 416–434 GHz, 439–467 GHz, 477–502 GHz, 523–527 GHz, 538–581 GHz, 611–630 GHz, 634–654 GHz, 657–692 GHz, 713–718 GHz, 729–733 GHz, 750–754 GHz, 771–776 GHz, 823–846 GHz, 850–854 GHz, 857–862 GHz, 866–882 GHz, 905–928 GHz, 951–956 GHz, 968–973 GHz and 985–990 GHz.\nIn the 2200 m and 630 m bands:\n\n\nAmateur stations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) and 472–479 kHz (630 m) bands shall only operate at fixed locations. Amateur stations shall not operate within a horizontal distance of one kilometer from a transmission line that conducts a power line carrier (PLC) signal in the 135.7–137.8 kHz or 472–479 kHz bands. Horizontal distance is measured from the station’s antenna to the closest point on the transmission line.\nPrior to commencement of operations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) and/or 472–479 kHz (630 m) bands, amateur operators shall notify the Utilities Telecom Council (UTC) of their intent to operate by submitting their call signs, intended band or bands of operation, and the coordinates of their antenna’s fixed location. Amateur stations will be permitted to commence operations after the 30-day period unless UTC notifies the station that its fixed location is located within one kilometer of PLC systems operating in the same or overlapping frequencies.\nAmateur stations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) band shall not cause harmful interference to, and shall accept interference from:\n\n\nStations authorized by the United States Government in the fixed and maritime mobile services;\nStations authorized by other nations in the fixed, maritime mobile, and radionavigation service.\n\n\nAmateur stations in the 472–479 kHz (630 m) band shall not cause harmful interference to, and shall accept interference from:\n\n\nStations authorized by the FCC in the maritime mobile service;\nStations authorized by other nations in the maritime mobile and aeronautical radionavigation services.\n\n\nAmateur stations causing harmful interference shall take all necessary measures to eliminate such interference—including temporary or permanent termination of transmissions.\n\n\n60 m band:\n\n\nIn the 5330.5–5406.4 kHz band (60 m band), amateur stations may transmit only on the five center frequencies specified in the table below. In order to meet this requirement, control operators of stations transmitting phone, data, and RTTY emissions (emission designators 2K80J3E, 2K80J2D, and 60H0J2B, respectively) may set the carrier frequency 1.5 kHz below the center frequency as specified in the table below. For CW emissions (emission designator 150HA1A), the carrier frequency is set to the center frequency. Amateur operators shall ensure that their emissions do not occupy more than 2.8 kHz centered on each of these center frequencies.\n\nExpand Table\n60 M Band Frequencies (kHz)\n\n\n\nCarrier\nCenter\n\n\n\n\n5330.5\n5332.0\n\n\n5346.5\n5348.0\n\n\n5357.0\n5358.5\n\n\n5371.5\n5373.0\n\n\n5403.5\n5405.0\n\n\n\n\nAmateur stations transmitting on the 60 m band must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by:\n\n\nThe United States (NTIA and FCC) and other nations in the fixed service; and\nOther nations in the mobile except aeronautical mobile service.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 7.2–7.3 MHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, international broadcast stations whose programming is intended for use within Region 1 or Region 3.\n\n\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 30 m band must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations by other nations in the fixed service. The licensee of the amateur station must make all necessary adjustments, including termination of transmissions, if harmful interference is caused.\nFor amateur stations located in ITU Regions 1 and 3: Amateur stations transmitting in the 146–148 MHz segment or the 10.00–10.45 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations of other nations in the fixed and mobile services.\nIn the 219–220 MHz segment:\n\n\nUse is restricted to amateur stations participating as forwarding stations in fixed point-to-point digital message forwarding systems, including intercity packet backbone networks. It is not available for other purposes.\nAmateur stations must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by:\n\n\nThe FCC in the Automated Maritime Telecommunications System (AMTS), the 218–219 MHz Service, and the 220 MHz Service, and television stations broadcasting on channels 11 and 13; and\nOther nations in the fixed and maritime mobile services.\n\n\nNo amateur station may transmit unless the licensee has given written notification of the station’s specific geographic location for such transmissions in order to be incorporated into a database that has been made available to the public. The notification must be given at least 30 days prior to making such transmissions. The notification must be given to: The American Radio Relay League, Inc., 225 Main Street, Newington, CT 06111–1494.\nNo amateur station may transmit from a location that is within 640 km of an AMTS coast station that operates in the 217–218 MHz and 219–220 MHz bands unless the amateur station licensee has given written notification of the station’s specific geographic location for such transmissions to the AMTS licensee. The notification must be given at least 30 days prior to making such transmissions. The location of AMTS coast stations using the 217–218/219–220 MHz channels may be obtained as noted in paragraph (l)(3) of this section.\nNo amateur station may transmit from a location that is within 80 km of an AMTS coast station that uses frequencies in the 217–218 MHz and 219–220 MHz bands unless that amateur station licensee holds written approval from that AMTS licensee.

Emissions outside the necessary bandwidth must not cause splatter or keyclick interference to operations on adjacent frequencies.\nAll spurious emissions from a station transmitter must be reduced to the greatest extent practicable. If any spurious emission, including chassis or power line radiation, causes harmful interference to the reception of another radio station, the licensee of the interfering amateur station is required to take steps to eliminate the interference, in accordance with good engineering practice.\nFor transmitters installed after January 1, 2003, the mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency below 30 MHz must be at least 43 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For transmitters installed on or before January 1, 2003, the mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency below 30 MHz must not exceed 50 mW and must be at least 40 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission. For a transmitter of mean power less than 5 W installed on or before January 1, 2003, the attenuation must be at least 30 dB. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement.\nThe mean power of any spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power amplifier transmitting on a frequency between 30–225 MHz must be at least 60 dB below the mean power of the fundamental. For a transmitter having a mean power of 25 W or less, the mean power of any spurious emission supplied to the antenna transmission line must not exceed 25 µW and must be at least 40 dB below the mean power of the fundamental emission, but need not be reduced below the power of 10 µW. A transmitter built before April 15, 1977, or first marketed before January 1, 1978, is exempt from this requirement.\nThe following standards and limitations apply to transmissions on the frequencies specified in § 97.305(c) of this part.\n\n\n\nNo angle-modulated emission may have a modulation index greater than 1 at the highest modulation frequency.\n\n\nNo non-phone emission shall exceed the bandwidth of a communications quality phone emission of the same modulation type. The total bandwidth of an independent sideband emission (having B as the first symbol), or a multiplexed image and phone emission, shall not exceed that of a communications quality A3E emission.\n\n\nOnly a RTTY or data emission using a specified digital code listed in § 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol rate must not exceed 300 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz.\n\n\nOnly a RTTY or data emission using a specified digital code listed in § 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol rate must not exceed 1200 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz.\n\n\nA RTTY, data or multiplexed emission using a specified digital code listed in § 97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol rate must not exceed 19.6 kilobauds.

    "text": "Phonetic alphabet\nAmateurs across the globe have agreed on a standard phonetic alphabet–a way of spelling out callsigns and words that makes them more easily understood when propagation might not be ideal.\nThe phonetic alphabet is often used on HF, but rarely on VHF or UHF FM. That’s because signals on VHF or UHF FM are often heard through repeaters and are usually very readable. So, if you’re transmitting on VHF or UHF through a repeater, you don’t need to use the phonetic alphabet.\nSome hams use different phonetic equivalents from the ones below, like “Wacko Three Tiny Microphone” for W3TM. As a rule of thumb, it’s better practice and the more common custom to use the standard phonetic alphabet. Sometimes under difficult operating conditions, like a busy contest, you might say “Whiskey Three TEXAS MASSACHUSETTS” or something unusual rather than “Whiskey Three Tango Mike”–if the other operator can’t quite copy the last part of your callsign after you’ve tried the standard phonetics several times.",

    "text": "There as many types of hams as there are people. Some rarely get on the air, and others are on all the time. Some home-brew all their own gear, others buy theirs. The common thread is that ham radio is about doing things, building, listening, transmitting, and learning about radio in all of its many facets.\nNaturally, there are many more radio-related activities a person can enjoy with a radio. But you might be surprised to know that there are a number of radio-active experiences, to borrow a phrase used by the ARRL, a person can enjoy without any radio at all. This section describes these in the form of a set of ‘quests’ that focus on a particular operating mode or facet of the hobby. They’re meant to give the quest-or a taste of what that part of ham radio is about. Try one, or try them all. And if you have ideas about how any of these quests could be improved, let me know.",

    "text": "About\nWe’ve shown that there are many ham-related activities that a person can enjoy without buying any new gear. But of course, buying or borrowing radio equipment dramatically expands what a ham or ham-to-be can do. There’s an old saying that if you ask two hams the same question about what gear to buy, they’ll give you three opinions, and you should ignore all of them. Ok, so that’s not much help. And it’s not completely true either. There is good advice out there. It’s just hard to find in the midst of the vast quantity of information.\nIn this short section, I’m going to give you a very opinionated take on how you should think about what gear to buy, not what specific bit of equipment to buy.\nBut before doing that, here are some general observations:",
