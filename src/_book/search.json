    "text": "1.2 Philosophy\nMost hams agree that getting their “ticket” or license was the start of the journey, not the destination. In fact, for many hams, much of the material that must be mastered to pass one of the licensing exams only really makes sense in the specific context of operating or doing something related to operating. So, our philosophy with this book is to emphasize hands-on activities, operating practices, and especially listening. Other hams may have other ideas about the right approach. We think that there are many good ways to go forward, and this one particularly appeals to us.\nIn the U.S., you don’t need a license to listen, and even if you are an active operator, you’ll spend most of your time listening. Many hams started out as shortwave listeners (SWLs) back when the airwaves were full of shortwave stations that broadcasted programs in the ham bands or adjacent to ham bands. And listening to other hams operate is one of the best ways to learn what to do, and sometimes, what not to do."

    "text": "There as many types of hams as there are people. Some rarely get on the air, and others are on all the time. Some home-brew all their own gear, others buy theirs. The common thread is that ham radio is about doing things, building, listening, transmitting, and learning about radio in all of its many facets.\nNaturally, there are many more radio-related activities a person can enjoy with a radio. But you might be surprised to know that there are a number of radio-active experiences, to borrow a phrase used by the ARRL, a person can enjoy without any radio at all. This section describes these in the form of a set of ‘quests’ that focus on a particular operating mode or facet of the hobby. They’re meant to give the quest-or a taste of what that part of ham radio is about. Try one, or try them all. And if you have ideas about how any of these quests could be improved, let me know."

    "text": "Visit the K3FEF web SDR\nGo to http://websdr.k3fef.com. This station is located in Milford, Pennsylvania on the Delaware River. It’s the closest one to Penn State. So, it’s often one to consult for listeners in our area.\nHere is a screenshot of the K3FEF control panel.\n\n\n\nK3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com\n\n\nThe dark blue area at the top depicts the band activity at the time you visit. The figure shows radio signals being heard by K3FEF from about 3300 kHz (3.3 MHz) below the 80m ham band to 5300 kHz (5.5 MHz) in the 60m ham band.\nIf you are watching this on the web, you will see upwards motion. This is how the webSDR depicts the time series or history of recent signals. So, time is on the vertical axis of this two-dimensional figure. Sometimes this type of frequency-over-time display is called a waterfall. Except this waterfall falls upward.\nBelow the figure are some orange ‘flag’ or labels that other listeners have added. These identify the specific transmissions. If you look especially closely, you’ll also see a yellow ‘hump’ around 3875 kHz. That’s the specific frequency this SDR defaulted to when we opened it up. We’ll explain what the yellow hump means a bit later.\nIn the static figure above, you’ll notice a lot of activity between about 3550 kHz and 4000 kHz. The 80m and 75m ham bands occupy 3500-4000 kHz, so those are hams communicating. The figure was taken about 8:00am EDT (1200 UTC). These bands are usually open from evening to mid-morning.\nLet’s focus on the white panel below the waterfall.\n\n\n\nK3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com\n\n\nThe panel’s Frequency control tells us that our radio is tuned to 3875 MHz, right in the middle of the 80/75m band, the phone (voice) portion. There are some controls to change the frequency, then below that, a set of buttons to change the band. The highlighted button confirms that we are in the 80/75m band1.\nNotice that the K3FEF webSDR covers ham bands up through 6m. It does not cover the 15m or 12m bands, though.\nBelow the Frequency control is a set of buttons that control Bandwidth. No, bandwidth is not the size of your favorite jazz combo. Bandwidth means how much of the frequency spectrum the webSDR is capturing at this moment, centered on the 3875 [kHz] frequency we just mentioned. Different types of radio transmissions (voice vs. Morse code/[CW] for example) have different bandwidths. We often want to adjust our bandwidth to match the type of signal. If the bandwidth is much wider than the signal, we’re just adding noise. If the bandwidth is much narrower than the signal, we can lose information. Voice transmissions have wider bandwidth than Morse code/[CW]. And different types of voice signals have different bandwidths. [FM] is the widest, for example; [AM] is in the middle; and single sideband [SSB] the narrowest.\nOur bandwidth is 9.69 [kHz] @ -6 [dB] 2. That’s wide, except for broadcast FM stations. We can adjust the bandwidth incrementally using the wider/narrower buttons or adjust the bandwidth to match a specific type of signal: CW-wide/CW-nrw (narrow), LSB-wide/LSB-nrw, USB-wide/USB-nrw, AM-wide/AM-nrw, and FM. We can also adjust the bandwidth manually."

Zoom in by clicking on the button a couple of times. Sometimes zooming moves window beyond the frequency where you are currently tuned. If that happens, you won’t see the yellow ‘hump’ anymore.\nBut you can find it again by clicking on the blue/purple area in the waterfall and dragging to the left or the right to put your current frequency–3875 kHz for our example–in the middle of the panel.\nIn our case, there’s a very strong signal around 3810 kHz.\n\n\n\nK3FEF webSDR at http://websdr.k3fef.com\n\n\nNotice that most of the signal around 3810 kHz (3.810 MHz) lies below 3810. That’s because on 75m and 80m, hams use Lower Sideband ([LSB]) for [phone] transmissions. To see another example of what LSB and upper sideband ([USB]) signals look like, see figure below."

    "text": "Going further\nNow that you’ve gotten familiar with the K3FEF WebSDR, you might be curious to know what else there is to listen to, and equally important, when. I say when because the high frequency (HF) bands change their propagation characteristics–how far and how well they convey radio signals–based on the time of day, season of the year, and phase of the 11-year sunspot cycle, among other characteristics. We’ll do a deeper dive on these topics in the Band Conditions quest. For now, here are some general rules of thumb about where to listen and when:\n75m/80m: These bands provide long distance (DX) communication at night, especially in the winter months, and regional communication in the early morning hours.\n40m: This band also provides long distance communication at night and more reliable regional communication in the daylight hours.\n20m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours.\n17m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours.\n15m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours.\n12m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours during the peak times of the sunspot cycle. It is often closed at the depth of that cycle.\n10m: This band supports long distance communication during daylight hours during the peak times of the sunspot cycle. It is often closed at the depth of that cycle.\nNow, you might be interested to know what’s worth listening to or for. My recommendation would be for you to listen to established nets that have published schedules. For example, you can search for a net that meets specific criteria on the ARRL website at www.arrl.org/arrl-net-directory-search. You may also want to try the NetFinder site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt would be good to add some information about some SWL stations that are easy to hear.\nAlso, there are some nets that are good examples, e.g., the M-Su Rooster Net on 3.990 MHz and the YSL System Nets, and some frequencies that are not good examples, e.g., 7.200 MHz and 14.313 MHz."

So, the approximate speed of light (in millions of meters per second) divided by the frequency in MHz gives us the approximate wavelength of radio waves. It’s a single 0.5 MHz (500 kHz) chunk of frequency reserved exclusively for amateurs that roughly bracket ~80-75m.↩︎\nThis means that if we look at the peak signal at 3875 kHz and calculate the point on both sides of 3875 kHz where the signal drops by 6 decibels (db) or about 4-fold, we’re left with 9.69 kHz of signal. The width of the yellow ‘hump’ in the waterfall display shows us this bandwidth visually.↩︎"

During the early morning hours, 80m/75m might support regional propagation, meaning you can hear stations within several hundred miles of your location. 60m and 40m might also work for regional communication throughout the day.\nThe higher bands (30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m) are long distance (DX) bands and are most active during the day and under good solar conditions.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen a station to hunt, you can try to hear them on a WebSDR."

But of course, buying or borrowing radio equipment dramatically expands what a ham or ham-to-be can do. There’s an old saying that if you ask two hams the same question about what gear to buy, they’ll give you three opinions, and you should ignore all of them. Ok, so that’s not much help.\nIn this short section, I’m going to give you a very opinionated take on how you should think about what gear to buy, not what specific bit of equipment to buy.\nBut before doing that, here are some general observations:\n\nThere is no perfect radio.\nMost hams who remain active in the hobby end up with more than one radio."

No frequency will be assigned for the exclusive use of any station.\nAt all times and on all frequencies, each control operator must give priority to stations providing emergency communications, except to stations transmitting communications for training drills and tests in RACES.\nNo amateur operator shall willfully or maliciously interfere with or cause interference to any radio communication or signal.\n\n\n\n§ 97.103 Station licensee responsibilities.\n\nThe station licensee is responsible for the proper operation of the station in accordance with the FCC Rules. When the control operator is a different amateur operator than the station licensee, both persons are equally responsible for proper operation of the station.\nThe station licensee must designate the station control operator. The FCC will presume that the station licensee is also the control operator, unless documentation to the contrary is in the station records.\nThe station licensee must make the station and the station records available for inspection upon request by an FCC representative.\n\n[54 FR 25857, June 20, 1989, as amended at 71 FR 66462, Nov. 15, 2006; 75 FR 27201, May 14, 2010]\n\n\n§ 97.105 Control operator duties.\n\nThe control operator must ensure the immediate proper operation of the station, regardless of the type of control.\nA station may only be operated in the manner and to the extent permitted by the privileges authorized for the class of operator license held by the control operator.\n\n\n\n§ 97.107 Reciprocal operating authority.\nA non-citizen of the United States (“alien”) holding an amateur service authorization granted by the alien’s government is authorized to be the control operator of an amateur station located at places where the amateur service is regulated by the FCC, provided there is in effect a multilateral or bilateral reciprocal operating arrangement, to which the United States and the alien’s government are parties, for amateur service operation on a reciprocal basis. The FCC will issue public announcements listing the countries with which the United States has such an arrangement. No citizen of the United States or person holding an FCC amateur operator/primary station license grant is eligible for the reciprocal operating authority granted by this section. The privileges granted to a control operator under this authorization are:\n\nFor an amateur service license granted by the Government of Canada:\n\n\n\nThe terms of the Convention Between the United States and Canada (TIAS No. 2508) Relating to the Operation by Citizens of Either Country of Certain Radio Equipment or Stations in the Other Country;\n\n\nThe operating terms and conditions of the amateur service license issued by the Government of Canada; and\n\n\nThe applicable rules of this part, but not to exceed the control operator privileges of an FCC-granted Amateur Extra Class operator license.\n\n\n\nFor an amateur service license granted by any country, other than Canada, with which the United States has a multilateral or bilateral agreement:\n\n\n\nThe terms of the agreement between the alien’s government and the United States;\n\n\nThe operating terms and conditions of the amateur service license granted by the alien’s government;\n\n\nThe applicable rules of this part, but not to exceed the control operator privileges of an FCC-granted Amateur Extra Class operator license; and\n\n\n\nAt any time the FCC may, in its discretion, modify, suspend or cancel the reciprocal operating authority granted to any person by this section.\n\n[63 FR 68979, Dec. 14, 1998]\n\n\n§ 97.109 Station control.\n\nEach amateur station must have at least one control point.\nWhen a station is being locally controlled, the control operator must be at the control point. Any station may be locally controlled.\nWhen a station is being remotely controlled, the control operator must be at the control point. Any station may be remotely controlled.\nWhen a station is being automatically controlled, the control operator need not be at the control point. Only stations specifically designated elsewhere in this part may be automatically controlled. Automatic control must cease upon notification by a Regional Director that the station is transmitting improperly or causing harmful interference to other stations. Automatic control must not be resumed without prior approval of the Regional Director.\n\n[54 FR 39535, Sept. 27, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 26001, May 16, 1995; 69 FR 24997, May 5, 2004; 80 FR 53753, Sept. 8, 2015]\n\n\n§ 97.111 Authorized transmissions.\n\nAn amateur station may transmit the following types of two-way communications:\n\n\n\nTransmissions necessary to exchange messages with other stations in the amateur service, except those in any country whose administration has notified the ITU that it objects to such communications.

Prior approval for manned spacecraft communications retransmissions must be obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Such retransmissions must be for the exclusive use of amateur radio operators. Propagation, weather forecasts, and manned spacecraft communications retransmissions may not be conducted on a regular basis, but only occasionally, as an incident of normal amateur radio communications.\nNo amateur station, except an auxiliary, repeater, or space station, may automatically retransmit the radio signals of other amateur station.\n\n[58 FR 43072, Aug. 13, 1993; 58 FR 47219, Sept. 8, 1993, as amended at 71 FR 25982, May 3, 2006; 71 FR 66462, Nov. 15, 2006; 75 FR 46857, Aug. 4, 2010; 79 FR 35291, June 20, 2014]\n\n\n§ 97.115 Third party communications.\n\nAn amateur station may transmit messages for a third party to:\n\n\n\nAny station within the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n\nAny station within the jurisdiction of any foreign government when transmitting emergency or disaster relief communications and any station within the jurisdiction of any foreign government whose administration has made arrangements with the United States to allow amateur stations to be used for transmitting international communications on behalf of third parties. No station shall transmit messages for a third party to any station within the jurisdiction of any foreign government whose administration has not made such an arrangement. This prohibition does not apply to a message for any third party who is eligible to be a control operator of the station.\n\n\n\nThe third party may participate in stating the message where:\n\n\n\nThe control operator is present at the control point and is continuously monitoring and supervising the third party’s participation; and\n\n\nThe third party is not a prior amateur service licensee whose license was revoked or not renewed after hearing and re-licensing has not taken place; suspended for less than the balance of the license term and the suspension is still in effect; suspended for the balance of the license term and re-licensing has not taken place; or surrendered for cancellation following notice of revocation, suspension or monetary forfeiture proceedings. The third party may not be the subject of a cease and desist order which relates to amateur service operation and which is still in effect.\n\n\n\nNo station may transmit third party communications while being automatically controlled except a station transmitting a RTTY or data emission.\nAt the end of an exchange of international third party communications, the station must also transmit in the station identification procedure the call sign of the station with which a third party message was exchanged.\n\n[54 FR 25857, June 20, 1989; 54 FR 39535, Sept. 27, 1989, as amended at 71 FR 25982, May 3, 2006; 71 FR 66462, Nov. 15, 2006]\n\n\n§ 97.117 International communications.\nTransmissions to a different country, where permitted, shall be limited to communications incidental to the purposes of the amateur service and to remarks of a personal character.\n[71 FR 25982, May 3, 2006]\n\n\n§ 97.119 Station identification.\n\nEach amateur station, except a space station or telecommand station, must transmit its assigned call sign on its transmitting channel at the end of each communication, and at least every 10 minutes during a communication, for the purpose of clearly making the source of the transmissions from the station known to those receiving the transmissions. No station may transmit unidentified communications or signals, or transmit as the station call sign, any call sign not authorized to the station.\nThe call sign must be transmitted with an emission authorized for the transmitting channel in one of the following ways:\n\n\n\nBy a CW emission. When keyed by an automatic device used only for identification, the speed must not exceed 20 words per minute;\n\n\nBy a phone emission in the English language. Use of a phonetic alphabet as an aid for correct station identification is encouraged;\n\n\nBy a RTTY emission using a specified digital code when all or part of the communications are transmitted by a RTTY or data emission;\n\n\nBy an image emission conforming to the applicable transmission standards, either color or monochrome, of § 73.682(a) of the FCC Rules when all or part of the communications are transmitted in the same image emission\n\n\n\nOne or more indicators may be included with the call sign. Each indicator must be separated from the call sign by the slant mark (/) or by any suitable word that denotes the slant mark.

The notification must be in accordance with the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations and must specify the information required by Appendix 4 and Resolution No. 642 of the ITU Radio Regulations. The notification must also include a description of the design and operational strategies that the space station will use to mitigate orbital debris, including the following information:\n\n\n\nA statement that the space station operator has assessed and limited the amount of debris released in a planned manner during normal operations. Where applicable, this statement must include an orbital debris mitigation disclosure for any separate deployment devices, distinct from the space station launch vehicle, that may become a source of orbital debris;\n\n\nA statement indicating whether the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability that the space station(s) will become a source of debris by collision with small debris or meteoroids that would cause loss of control and prevent disposal.

The probability shall be calculated using the NASA Debris Assessment Software or a higher fidelity assessment tool. The collision risk may be assumed zero for a space station during any period in which the space station will be maneuvered effectively to avoid colliding with large objects.\nThe statement must identify characteristics of the space station(s)’ orbits that may present a collision risk, including any planned and/or operational space stations in those orbits, and indicate what steps, if any, have been taken to coordinate with the other spacecraft or system, or what other measures the operator plans to use to avoid collision.\nIf at any time during the space station(s)’ mission or de-orbit phase the space station(s) will transit through the orbits used by any inhabitable spacecraft, including the International Space Station, the statement must describe the design and operational strategies, if any, that will be used to minimize the risk of collision and avoid posing any operational constraints to the inhabitable spacecraft.\nThe statement must disclose the accuracy, if any, with which orbital parameters will be maintained, including apogee, perigee, inclination, and the right ascension of the ascending node(s). In the event that a system is not be maintained to specific orbital tolerances, e.g., its propulsion system will not be used for orbital maintenance, that fact should be included in the debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems must also indicate the anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of the proposed satellite or satellites. All systems must describe the extent of satellite maneuverability, whether or not the space station design includes a propulsion system.\nThe space station operator must certify that upon receipt of a space situational awareness conjunction warning, the operator will review and take all possible steps to assess the collision risk, and will mitigate the collision risk if necessary. As appropriate, steps to assess and mitigate the collision risk should include, but are not limited to: Contacting the operator of any active spacecraft involved in such a warning; sharing ephemeris data and other appropriate operational information with any such operator; and modifying space station attitude and/or operations.\n\n\nWhere a space station requests the assignment of a geostationary orbit location, it must assess whether there are any known satellites located at, or reasonably expected to be located at, the requested orbital location, or assigned in the vicinity of that location, such that the station keeping volumes of the respective satellites might overlap or touch. If so, the statement must include a statement as to the identities of those parties and the measures that will be taken to prevent collisions.\n\n\nA statement addressing the trackability of the space station(s). Space station(s) operating in low-Earth orbit will be presumed trackable if each individual space station is 10 cm or larger in its smallest dimension, exclusive of deployable components. Where the application is for an NGSO space station or system, the statement shall also disclose the following:\n\n\nHow the operator plans to identify the space station(s) following deployment and whether space station tracking will be active or passive;\nWhether, prior to deployment, the space station(s) will be registered with the 18th Space Control Squadron or successor entity; and\nThe extent to which the space station operator plans to share information regarding initial deployment, ephemeris, and/or planned maneuvers with the 18th Space Control Squadron or successor entity, other entities that engage in space situational awareness or space traffic management functions, and/or other operators.\n\n\nA statement disclosing planned proximity operations, if any, and addressing debris generation that will or may result from the proposed operations, including any planned release of debris, the risk of accidental explosions, the risk of accidental collision, and measures taken to mitigate those risks.\nA statement detailing the disposal plans for the space station, including the quantity of fuel—if any—that will be reserved for disposal maneuvers. In addition, the following specific provisions apply:\n\n\nFor geostationary orbit space stations, the statement must disclose the altitude selected for a disposal orbit and the calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude.\nFor space stations terminating operations in an orbit in or passing through the low-Earth orbit region below 2,000 km altitude, the statement must disclose whether the spacecraft will be disposed of either through atmospheric re-entry, specifying if direct retrieval of the spacecraft will be used. The statement must also disclose the expected time in orbit for the space station following the completion of the mission.\nFor space stations not covered by either paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(A) or (B) of this section, the statement must indicate whether disposal will involve use of a storage orbit or long-term atmospheric re-entry and rationale for the selected disposal plan.\nFor all NGSO space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(B) or (C) of this section, the following additional specific provisions apply:\n\n\nThe statement must include a demonstration that the probability of success of the chosen disposal method will be 0.9 or greater for any individual space station. For space station systems consisting of multiple space stations, the demonstration should include additional information regarding efforts to achieve a higher probability of success, with a goal, for large systems, of a probability of success for any individual space station of 0.99 or better. For space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(B) of this section that will be terminating operations in or passing through low-Earth orbit, successful disposal is defined as atmospheric re-entry of the spacecraft within 25 years or less following completion of the mission. For space stations under paragraph (g)(1)(vii)(C) of this section, successful disposal will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nIf planned disposal is by atmospheric re-entry, the statement must also include:\n\n\nA disclosure indicating whether the atmospheric re-entry will be an uncontrolled re-entry or a controlled targeted reentry.\nAn assessment as to whether portions of any individual spacecraft will survive atmospheric re-entry and impact the surface of the Earth with a kinetic energy in excess of 15 joules, and demonstration that the calculated casualty risk for an individual spacecraft using the NASA Debris Assessment Software or a higher fidelity assessment tool is less than 0.0001 (1 in 10,000).\nIf any material item described in this notification changes before launch, a replacement pre-space notification shall be filed with the International Bureau no later than 90 days before integration of the space station into the launch vehicle.\n\n\nAn in-space station notification is required no later than 7 days following initiation of space station transmissions. This notification must update the information contained in the pre-space notification.\nA post-space station notification is required no later than 3 months after termination of the space station transmissions.

2020]\n\n\n§ 97.303 Frequency sharing requirements.\nThe following paragraphs summarize the frequency sharing requirements that apply to amateur stations transmitting in the frequency bands specified in § 97.301 of this part. Each frequency band allocated to the amateur service is designated as either a secondary service or a primary service. A station in a secondary service must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations in a primary service.\n\nWhere, in adjacent ITU Regions or sub-Regions, a band of frequencies is allocated to different services of the same category (i.e., primary or secondary services), the basic principle is the equality of right to operate. Accordingly, stations of each service in one Region or sub-Region must operate so as not to cause harmful interference to any service of the same or higher category in the other Regions or sub-Regions.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 70 cm band, the 33 cm band, the 23 cm band, the 5 cm band, the 3 cm band, or the 24.05–24.25 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States Government in the radiolocation service.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 76–81 GHz segment, the 136–141 GHz segment, or the 241–248 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States Government, the FCC, or other nations in the radiolocation service.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 430–450 MHz segment, the 23 cm band, the 3.3–3.4 GHz segment, the 5.65–5.85 GHz segment, the 13 cm band, or the 24.05–24.25 GHz segment, must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by other nations in the radiolocation service.\nAmateur stations receiving in the 33 cm band, the 2400–2450 MHz segment, the 5.725–5.875 GHz segment, the 1.2 cm band, the 2.5 mm band, or the 244–246 GHz segment must accept interference from industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the following segments must not cause harmful interference to radio astronomy stations: 76–81 GHz, 136–141 GHz, 241–248 GHz, 275–323 GHz, 327–371 GHz, 388–424 GHz, 426–442 GHz, 453–510 GHz, 623–711 GHz, 795–909 GHz, or 926–945 GHz. In addition, amateur stations transmitting in the following segments must not cause harmful interference to stations in the Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) or the space research service (passive): 275–286 GHz, 296–306 GHz, 313–356 GHz, 361–365 GHz, 369–392 GHz, 397–399 GHz, 409–411 GHz, 416–434 GHz, 439–467 GHz, 477–502 GHz, 523–527 GHz, 538–581 GHz, 611–630 GHz, 634–654 GHz, 657–692 GHz, 713–718 GHz, 729–733 GHz, 750–754 GHz, 771–776 GHz, 823–846 GHz, 850–854 GHz, 857–862 GHz, 866–882 GHz, 905–928 GHz, 951–956 GHz, 968–973 GHz and 985–990 GHz.\nIn the 2200 m and 630 m bands:\n\n\nAmateur stations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) and 472–479 kHz (630 m) bands shall only operate at fixed locations. Amateur stations shall not operate within a horizontal distance of one kilometer from a transmission line that conducts a power line carrier (PLC) signal in the 135.7–137.8 kHz or 472–479 kHz bands. Horizontal distance is measured from the station’s antenna to the closest point on the transmission line.\nPrior to commencement of operations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) and/or 472–479 kHz (630 m) bands, amateur operators shall notify the Utilities Telecom Council (UTC) of their intent to operate by submitting their call signs, intended band or bands of operation, and the coordinates of their antenna’s fixed location. Amateur stations will be permitted to commence operations after the 30-day period unless UTC notifies the station that its fixed location is located within one kilometer of PLC systems operating in the same or overlapping frequencies.\nAmateur stations in the 135.7–137.8 kHz (2200 m) band shall not cause harmful interference to, and shall accept interference from:\n\n\nStations authorized by the United States Government in the fixed and maritime mobile services;\nStations authorized by other nations in the fixed, maritime mobile, and radionavigation service.\n\n\nAmateur stations in the 472–479 kHz (630 m) band shall not cause harmful interference to, and shall accept interference from:\n\n\nStations authorized by the FCC in the maritime mobile service;\nStations authorized by other nations in the maritime mobile and aeronautical radionavigation services.\n\n\nAmateur stations causing harmful interference shall take all necessary measures to eliminate such interference—including temporary or permanent termination of transmissions.\n\n\n60 m band:\n\n\nIn the 5330.5–5406.4 kHz band (60 m band), amateur stations may transmit only on the five center frequencies specified in the table below. In order to meet this requirement, control operators of stations transmitting phone, data, and RTTY emissions (emission designators 2K80J3E, 2K80J2D, and 60H0J2B, respectively) may set the carrier frequency 1.5 kHz below the center frequency as specified in the table below. For CW emissions (emission designator 150HA1A), the carrier frequency is set to the center frequency. Amateur operators shall ensure that their emissions do not occupy more than 2.8 kHz centered on each of these center frequencies.\n\nExpand Table\n60 M Band Frequencies (kHz)\n\n\n\nCarrier\nCenter\n\n\n\n\n5330.5\n5332.0\n\n\n5346.5\n5348.0\n\n\n5357.0\n5358.5\n\n\n5371.5\n5373.0\n\n\n5403.5\n5405.0\n\n\n\n\nAmateur stations transmitting on the 60 m band must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by:\n\n\nThe United States (NTIA and FCC) and other nations in the fixed service; and\nOther nations in the mobile except aeronautical mobile service.\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 7.2–7.3 MHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, international broadcast stations whose programming is intended for use within Region 1 or Region 3.\n\n\nAmateur stations transmitting in the 30 m band must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations by other nations in the fixed service. The licensee of the amateur station must make all necessary adjustments, including termination of transmissions, if harmful interference is caused.\nFor amateur stations located in ITU Regions 1 and 3: Amateur stations transmitting in the 146–148 MHz segment or the 10.00–10.45 GHz segment must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations of other nations in the fixed and mobile services.\nIn the 219–220 MHz segment:\n\n\nUse is restricted to amateur stations participating as forwarding stations in fixed point-to-point digital message forwarding systems, including intercity packet backbone networks. It is not available for other purposes.\nAmateur stations must not cause harmful interference to, and must accept interference from, stations authorized by:\n\n\nThe FCC in the Automated Maritime Telecommunications System (AMTS), the 218–219 MHz Service, and the 220 MHz Service, and television stations broadcasting on channels 11 and 13; and\nOther nations in the fixed and maritime mobile services.\n\n\nNo amateur station may transmit unless the licensee has given written notification of the station’s specific geographic location for such transmissions in order to be incorporated into a database that has been made available to the public. The notification must be given at least 30 days prior to making such transmissions. The notification must be given to: The American Radio Relay League, Inc., 225 Main Street, Newington, CT 06111–1494.\nNo amateur station may transmit from a location that is within 640 km of an AMTS coast station that operates in the 217–218 MHz and 219–220 MHz bands unless the amateur station licensee has given written notification of the station’s specific geographic location for such transmissions to the AMTS licensee. The notification must be given at least 30 days prior to making such transmissions.
