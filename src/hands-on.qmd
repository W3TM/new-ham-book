# Hands-on hamming

There as many types of hams as there are people.
Some rarely get on the air, and others are on all the time.
Some home-brew all their own gear, others buy theirs.
The common thread is that ham radio is about doing things, building, listening, transmitting, and learning about radio in all of its many facets.

Naturally, there are many more radio-related activities a person can enjoy with a radio.
But you might be surprised to know that there are a number of radio-active experiences, to borrow a phrase used by the ARRL, a person can enjoy *without any radio at all*.
This section describes these in the form of a set of 'quests' that focus on a particular operating mode or facet of the hobby.
They're meant to give the quest-or a taste of what that part of ham radio is about.
Try one, or try them all.
And if you have ideas about how any of these quests could be improved, let me know.
