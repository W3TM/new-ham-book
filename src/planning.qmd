# Planning {-}

## About {-}

Before you spend a dollar, I suggest that you put some time into planning the initial phases of your ham "career".
Your interests will probably change over time, but it's a good idea to start with what excites you about the hobby right now.
Here are some questions to consider.
None of them have either/or answers.

## Questions {-}

- *Where* do you plan to operate?

From home, in your car, or from a portable location like a park or a mountain summit?

- *What mode or modes* do you want to operate in these places?

Voice (SSB or FM), digital modes, or CW?

- *What type(s) of activities* interest you in using these modes?

Special event support, contesting, SOTA/POTA, rag-chewing, nets.

- *Who* do you want to communicate with?

People you don't know (yet) or very specific individuals.

And last, but certainly not the least important:

- *How much* do you have to spend?

In my opinion, the first question, *where* you plan to operate, has the biggest influence on your choices.
So, what follows are three separate chapters relating to setting up a fixed station at-home, operating mobile (from a vehicle), and field or portable operations.
